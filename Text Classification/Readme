Text Classification - Sentiment Analysis with Neutral Sentiment
Overview
This project implements a sentiment analysis model to classify text data into
three categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral. 
The model uses a pre-trained DistilBERT model fine-tuned on the SST-2 dataset for sentiment classification.
The project demonstrates how to use the Hugging Face transformers library to perform sentiment analysis, evaluate model performance, 
and visualize results such as confusion matrix and sentiment distribution.
Key Features
